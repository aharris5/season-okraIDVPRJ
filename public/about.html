        <p>Why did you start Indie Realm?                   </p>
        <p> -We wanted to allow gamers to have a central spot in this vast internet where they could easily go to and find the best Indie games and support developers who don't use financials from a publisher. So the money goes directly to the man or team that created the game!     </p>
        <p>What is an Indie Game?</p>
         <p> -An independent video game (commonly referred to as an indie game) is a game that is created without the financial support of a publisher. Basically, the developers use their own personal funds or crowdsource for starting capital in order to potentially hire a small team and begin development on their video game.</p>
